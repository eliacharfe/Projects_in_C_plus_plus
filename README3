  Counts equal left
  ==============================================

  ==============================================
 This program is building a binary tree. Then send the head (root) to another
 function that counts how many section cross the value in the section is
 equal to the its left child
  Input: serie of integers
  Output: the counter

  g++ -Wall ex3a.cc -o ex3a
  valgrind ./ex3a < test
===================================================
./ex3b
  Biggest under tree of same quarter
  ==============================================
  This program is building a binary tree of points sorted by ID, then calling
  a function that return a pointer to the head of the under tree that all the
  points underness it are in the same quarter as the head point of the under
  tree.
  if doesnt find return 0 0 .
  Input: ID (of a point), x coordinate, y coordinate.
  Output: The head of the pointer that point to the biggest under tree that
  fit the conditions

  g++ -Wall ex3b.cc -o ex3b
  valgrind ./ex3b < test
===================================================
./ex3c
  Biggest under tree with sequence order
  ==============================================
  This program is building a binary tree of points sorted by order of the
  input, reading integers from the user. The program is checking the
  biggest under tree that it childs are put in order (+1 in the ID for the
  child of each section cross.
  a function that return a pointer to the head of the under tree that all the
  sections underness fit the condition.
  Input: integers until eof.
  Output: The head of the pointer that point to the biggest under tree that
  fit the conditions

  g++ -Wall ex3c.cc -o ex3c
  valgrind ./ex3c < test
===================================================
